# Implementation Plan: Texas Hold'em Quiz

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- Initialize npm project with webpack/parcel for bundling
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Configure development environment with hot reloading
- Create basic HTML structure and CSS framework

### 1.2 Card System
- Design card data structure (suit, rank, display)
- Implement card deck initialization and shuffling
- Create card rendering component (SVG or image-based)
- Build card display layouts for community cards and player hands

### 1.3 Game State Management
- Define game state structure (players, cards, stage)
- Implement state initialization for different scenarios
- Create functions for random scenario generation
- Build state validation logic

## Phase 2: Core Quiz Logic (Week 2)

### 2.1 Probability Engine
- Research and implement hand evaluation algorithm
- Choose probability calculation approach:
  - Option A: Monte Carlo simulation (more flexible, slower)
  - Option B: Pre-calculated lookup tables (faster, limited scenarios)
  - Option C: Hybrid approach with caching
- Optimize performance for client-side execution
- Add unit tests for hand evaluation accuracy

### 2.2 Quiz Mechanics
- Implement question generation logic
- Create answer validation system
- Build scoring and streak tracking
- Add timer functionality (optional)

### 2.3 User Interface
- Design quiz question display layout
- Create player hand selection interface
- Implement probability range slider for alternative mode
- Add visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

## Phase 3: Features & Polish (Week 3)

### 3.1 Settings & Customization
- Build settings panel UI
- Implement parameter locking (cards revealed, player count)
- Add difficulty levels
- Create quiz mode toggle (highest percentage vs. probability range)

### 3.2 Feedback & Learning
- Show correct answer with detailed probability breakdown
- Display hand strength comparisons
- Add explanation tooltips for poker hand rankings
- Implement progress tracking and statistics

### 3.3 Visual Enhancements
- Add smooth animations for card reveals
- Create appealing color schemes and themes
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- Add sound effects (optional, with mute option)

## Phase 4: Optimization & Deployment (Week 4)

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- Profile and optimize probability calculations
- Implement web workers for heavy computations
- Add progressive loading for assets
- Minimize bundle size for faster loading

### 4.2 Testing & Quality
- Comprehensive unit tests for game logic
- Integration tests for quiz flow
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing

### 4.3 Deployment
- Configure GitHub Pages settings
- Set up custom domain (optional)
- Create deployment documentation
- Add analytics tracking (privacy-conscious)

## Technical Decisions to Make

1. **Probability Calculation Method**
   - Monte Carlo: More accurate, handles all scenarios, but computationally intensive
   - Lookup Tables: Instant results but limited to pre-calculated scenarios
   - Recommendation: Start with Monte Carlo, optimize with caching

2. **Card Visualization**
   - SVG: Scalable, customizable, smaller file size
   - PNG Images: Traditional look, easier to implement
   - Recommendation: SVG for flexibility and performance

3. **State Management**
   - Vanilla JavaScript with modules
   - Lightweight library (Alpine.js, Petite Vue)
   - Recommendation: Start vanilla, add library if complexity grows

4. **Build Tool**
   - Webpack: Full-featured, complex configuration
   - Parcel: Zero-config, fast
   - Vite: Modern, fast, good defaults
   - Recommendation: Vite for modern development experience

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Issues**: Pre-calculate common scenarios, use web workers
2. **Accuracy Concerns**: Validate against established poker calculators
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Design mobile-first, test early
4. **Scope Creep**: Focus on MVP features first, iterate based on feedback

## Success Metrics

- Quiz loads in under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Probability calculations complete within 100ms
- 95%+ accuracy compared to professional poker calculators
- Intuitive UI requiring no poker knowledge to navigate
